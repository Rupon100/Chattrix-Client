      posts (show necessary information). There will be two badges and these
      badges will be visible only on the My Profile page when the conditions are
      fulfilled: Bronze Badge: If a user registers on the site, he/ she will
      receive the Bronze badge. Or, Gold Badge: If a user becomes a member (see
      req 7), he/ she will be rewarded the Gold badge. Note: You can use a
      picture/icon for the badge. It is up to you. Keep it relevant.
